# why-you-should-switch-away-from-npm-nodejs
This is a Collection of NodeJS NPM Related Arguments against the usage of NodeJS and NPM as also offering better alternatives.

## First of all what are the alternativs?
Usage of directly git and the git protocol is the key. It also saves you from bundling and packageing issues its all built in already. As the most people prefer easy over simple and the amount of developers exponential growth there is a gap between knowleg transfer from old expirenced to Young Coders or Coders that got teached by Coders that do not had time to care for the Bigger Picture. 

This book trys to Convince you and educate you to switch away from Packaging to Modular Composition in your Projects. No Matter what kind of Project that is also no Matter which languages it is written in this is a Universal Concept it applys to everything always it does not change it can only made incremental better we can change details and make variations but the fundamentals stay.

What is a VM? There are 2 Types of VM's Binary Once and so called Hardware Once which are Implemented via the Watch function of the Kernel the so called VMM Interfaces and API's 

Your Browser and your ECMAScript/JS Engine Are Fully blown container vms which implement binary sandboxing in a variaty of ways as this tech did evolve and not everything got always upgraded. But we are in fact at current point in time in a state where we can rethink some parts of the tooling and code we depend on to build our projects. I did a lot of research into common interfaces of code it self and virtual machines as also security and application development as also deployment and runtime observation.

I identified overlapping replication all over we did ruin in fact software development and the web at a whole the more deep i looked into over 10 000 Codebases the last 30 years and not only the old once also always tracking the most new exciting stuff and always identifing the key implementation details abstracted to the principles of simple software design. And i need to repeat simple is not easy simple means unwinded so a single circle the fundamentals of computing the turing principles.
